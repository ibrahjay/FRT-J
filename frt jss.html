        <H1>HISTORY OF FORT JESUS</H1>
    <p1>Fort Jesus, located on Mombasa Island, was built between 1593 and 1596 by the Portuguese to protect the Old Port of Mombasa. Designed by Giovanni Battista Cairati, the fort was a key part of the Portuguese effort to control Indian Ocean trade. It was built in a Renaissance style, with local Swahili labor contributing to its construction. The fort's shape resembles a man lying on his back, and it is considered a masterpiece of military architecture.</p1><br>

    <p2>Throughout its history, Fort Jesus was captured and recaptured multiple times. The Portuguese lost it to Sultan Yusuf of Mombasa in 1631, but regained it in 1632. In 1698, the Omanis seized it after a long siege, marking the end of Portuguese control. The fort later passed through different hands, including local rule and the British, who turned it into a prison in 1895.</p2><br>
